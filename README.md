# Gomps Game Settings

There will always be games that don't work perfectly with the default GOMPS settings. This repo hosts good GOMPS settings for specific games.

File names have the format `[game-id].json`. The game ID can be found in Gomps Manager, next to the game's name. For example, for the game "Grow Home", the entry looks like `Grow Home  Legacy MONO x86  ID: growhome`. In this case, the ID is just `growhome`, and the settings file would be `growhome.json`.
